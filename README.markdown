# Andre's dotfiles

This is where I will be storing my dot files. This is a work in progress as I try to increase
my productivity with Unix/Linux. Some of the files are just defaults at the moment, but that
will change over time as I use different computers and operating systems.

# install

Clone the repo, and run

    ./install.sh

which creates symlinks in `$HOME` to everything in `files/`. It won't clobber any files that are
already there with the same name.

# license
